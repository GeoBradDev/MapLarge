##  Development Notes

All code was authored and tested by me. I used standard developer resources throughout the process, including documentation, debugging tools, and LLMs as a productivity assistant. Assistance included help with syntax clarification, UI layout suggestions, and code organization. All architectural decisions, logic design, and implementation were my own.

This reflects how I typically approach real-world development tasks: writing code I understand, can defend, and am prepared to iterate on based on team feedback.
